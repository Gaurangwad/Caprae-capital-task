Feature to Enhance: Lead Scoring &amp; Prioritization
Why This Feature?
Business Use Case (2025):

Modern B2B sales teams are overloaded with leads; prioritizing the most promising ones is key to higher conversion rates and pipeline velocity.

Investors (like Caprae Capital) want platforms that show clear ROI and help teams focus efforts where they'll have the biggest impact.

UX/UI Perspective:

Users need a simple, visual way to understand which leads are “hot” and why.

Good lead scoring minimizes wasted effort, making the platform feel smart and efficient.

Industry Alignment:

Leading platforms (ZoomInfo, HubSpot, LeadFuze, Persana AI, Salesforce Einstein) use advanced, AI-driven lead scoring based on company fit, buyer intent, behavior, market signals, and historical conversion data.

Real-time scoring, dynamic criteria, integration with CRM, and explainable models are now standard.

AI for Growth:

Integrated AI models can analyze multiple data points—firmographics, engagement metrics, recent signals, financial health, intent data—to continuously rank leads.

Combine revenue estimates, enrichment data, external signals, and history (e.g., LinkedIn activity or web behavior) for robust predictions.

Use AI to recommend “next best action” for top leads.

Caprae Capital Vision:

Differentiates the product with actionable intelligence, supports portfolio companies in scaling faster, and offers measurable, data-backed outcomes.
